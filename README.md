# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Analysis classification project
 
 
This repository contains an analysis project focused on the prediction of cardiovascular risk using a dataset with various features related to individuals' health and lifestyle factors. The project aims to analyze the dataset and build predictive models to assess the ten-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD).

# Dataset
 
The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' health and lifestyle factors, along with their ten-year risk of developing CHD. The dataset consists of the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each individual

age: Age of the individual (numeric)

education: Level of education (categorical)

sex: Gender of the individual (binary: 1 for male, 0 for female)

is_smoking: Whether the individual is a smoker or not (binary: 1 if smoker, 0 if non-smoker)

cigsPerDay: Number of cigarettes smoked per day (numeric)

BPMeds: Whether the individual is taking blood pressure medication or not (binary: 1 if taking medication, 0 if not)

prevalentStroke: Whether the individual has a history of stroke or not (binary: 1 if prevalent, 0 if not)

prevalentHyp: Whether the individual has prevalent hypertension or not (binary: 1 if prevalent, 0 if not)

diabetes: Whether the individual has diabetes or not (binary: 1 if diabetic, 0 if not)

totChol: Total cholesterol level (numeric)

sysBP: Systolic blood pressure (numeric)

diaBP: Diastolic blood pressure (numeric)

BMI: Body Mass Index (numeric)

heartRate: Resting heart rate (numeric)

glucose: Blood glucose level (numeric)

TenYearCHD: Ten-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (binary: 1 if risk present, 0 if no risk)

# Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the cardiovascular risk prediction dataset.

Analyze the relationship between various health and lifestyle factors and the ten-year risk of developing CHD.

Preprocess and clean the data to handle missing values and outliers.

Build machine learning models to predict the ten-year risk of developing CHD based on the given features.

Evaluate the performance of the prediction models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

Identify the most important features contributing to the prediction of cardiovascular risk.

Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis for cardiovascular risk assessment and prevention.
